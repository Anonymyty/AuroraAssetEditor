# AuroraAssetEditor
A Graphical editor for Aurora's .asset files

There will be more features added to this tool as i find the time to do so, first version only supports reading/writing Aurora .asset files

A Huge thanks goes out to MaesterRowen for explaining the format for me, and also for making the AuroraAsset.dll library which handles the image conversion (between D3DTexture and Bitmap)
